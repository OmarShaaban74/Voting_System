# Voting System between four candidates  
### In this project, I've developed a sophisticated Voting System that brings together the Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD display, and keypad interface. Here's how it works:
# 1- Four dynamic candidates to choose from (1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣, 4️⃣).
# 2- Cast your vote effortlessly by pressing the corresponding number on the keypad.
# 3- Simply press the "AC" button, and the LCD screen will proudly display the victorious candidate.
# 4- Ready to start anew? The system resets automatically, ensuring a seamless voting experience.

### This Voting System is built following a layered model approach, with distinct App, HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), and MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer) components by implementing:
GPIO, LCD, and Keypad drivers, and all header files all crafted from scratch
